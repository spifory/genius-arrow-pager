# genius-arrow-pager

A browser extension that lets you page through an album's tracklist on [Genius](https://genius.com) using your right and left arrow keys.

This means you do not have to go to the bottom of the page and click on the next song.

# Usage

| Without the extension                                               | With the extension                                            |

<sup>An example where I page through [The Weeknd](https://genius.com/artists/The-weeknd)'s ["After Hours"](https://genius.com/albums/The-weeknd/After-hours) (great album, btw)</sup>
